# IAR-VSC-thrift

This is a fork of the `iar-vsc` Visual Studio code extension, available at https://github.com/pluyckx/iar-vsc .
Unlike the original extension, this fork adds an IAR view to the Activity bar where users are able to manipulate the file structure in `.ewp` project files directly, and to read which build configurations they support.


## Building

See `Extension/README.md`.

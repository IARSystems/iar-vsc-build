On windows, the extension automatically finds IAR Embedded Workbench and IAR Build Tools installations.
If you are using linux or you have moved an installation from its original location, you may need to manually
add a toolchain to the extension.

To add an IAR toolchain installation, select `Add Workbench...` from the dropdown in ...

You can also manually edit the `Install directories` in the extension settings, to add or remove folders the extension
searches for IAR toolchain installations.

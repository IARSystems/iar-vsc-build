## Release Notes

### [1.1.0-beta1](https://github.com/pluyckx/iar-vsc/releases/tag/1.1.0-beta1)

* Implement #28: Add support to generate build tasks using the VSCode built-in command `Tasks: Configure Task`.
* Fix #18: Save all files before build. (this is actually fixed because we are now using tasks)
* Add settings to test a generic launch script to start debugging.

### [1.0.0](https://github.com/pluyckx/iar-vsc/releases/tag/1.0.0)

* Add __root to default defines
* Add keywords so the extension is easier to find in the marketplace

### [1.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/pluyckx/iar-vsc/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta1)

* Add listeners to the define settings so the cpptools config file is generated when changed
* Fix issue when cpptools config file is empty or invalid: plugin would not load
* Add some more settings for default c and c++ standard configuration

### [1.0.0-alpha2](https://github.com/pluyckx/iar-vsc/releases/tag/1.0.0-alpha2)

* Correct relative include paths in cpptools config file
* Add `=` sign to default defines in settings
* Add a problem matcher

### [1.0.0-alpha1](https://github.com/pluyckx/iar-vsc/releases/tag/1.0.0-alpha1)

* Redisgned the extension
* Instead of completely command drive, status bar items are added to configure most things
* Automatically monitor the selected ewp file and auto generate the config file
* Only generate one config file `IAR` in the `c_cpp_properties.json` file. Changing between projects/configurations will
  automatically trigger an update of the `IAR` config section in the json file.
* Move all settings from iar-vsc.json to the configuration file of vscode. This way configurations are reusable.
* Make extension platform aware so you can choose from all compilers from the selected workbench.
* Add new setting to define your own `defines` through the IAR settings. This way it is possible to define the intrinsics
  of your compiler so you do not have to wait for extension updates.
* Add command to open IAR workbench. For now only the workbench opens without a workspace. See Issue #24 @ GitHub.
* Extension is now loaded when the workspace contains `.ewp` files.
* Added basic unit- and integrationtests.
* Probably a lot more...

### [0.0.3](https://github.com/pluyckx/iar-vsc/releases/tag/0.0.3)

* Fixes #1: Extension did not detect end of build command
* Fixes #3: Renamed iar-vsc.js to iar-vsc.json
